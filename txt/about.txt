Pose & Rank is a free service for scoring protein-ligand complexes, using two atomic distance-dependent statistical scoring functions: PoseScore and RankScore [1]. PoseScore was optimized for recognizing native binding geometries of ligands from other poses. RankScore was optimized for distinguishing ligands from nonbinding molecules. 

<p><p>

The input includes the 3D structure of the protein receptor, the binding/docking poses of small molecules in that protein. The output is a list of scores for each protein-small molecule complexes.

<p><p>

PoseScore ranks a native/near-native binding pose the best, top 5 and top 10 for 88%, 97% and 99% targets (Fig 1). PoseScore accuracy is comparable to that of DrugScore(CSD) and ITScore/SE, and superior to 12 other tested scoring functions. RankScore improved the ligand enrichment (logAUC) and early enrichment (EF1) scores computed by DOCK 3.6 for 68% and 74% targets, respectively. RankScore performed better at rescoring than each of seven other scoring functions tested. Therefore, PoseScore can be used for protein-ligand complex structure prediction, by ranking different conformations of a given protein-ligand pair. RankScore can facilitate ligand discovery, by ranking complexes of the target with different small molecules.
